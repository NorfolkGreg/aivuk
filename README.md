# AIVuk Theme
Fully responsive.

## Status
Theme currently under construction as a first project

## Theme Design
The theme was designed for a quasi-legal professional organisation and
therefore is particularly suitable for a text oriented site with only occasional
decorative images to break up the text..

## Theme Features
A colour scheme with accents in orange and brown with a warm white background.

Header/Menu area include facility for a Site Logo and Site Name and Strap Line
each in their own font and to a colour scheme to meet the needs of the
organisation for which it was originally designed.

Headings h1 and h2 feature a graphic bullet intended to be the company logo.
h3 headings show in heading colour in bold, at the start of the following
paragraph. Heading text for these main headings is brown (except within a
"boxout").

Terms within Description Lists are coloured brown.

### The Boxout Feature
A "div" of class "boxout" is available that will provide an indented border
in the site's orange colour. h2 headings within the boxout also appear orange.

### Image Classes
Images may be given one of three classes which behave as follows:

"center": These display as a block and will fill 80% of the page width.

"right": These display floated right on wider screens and will not occupy
more than 60% of page width. On narrow screens they behave as a centered image.

"portrait": This class is designed for 200px square images showing people's
faces. On wider screens they float right and are of fixed dimensions. On
narrow screens they display as a block centred.

### Post Code Links
The theme comes with some additional files designed for use within the UK,
but may be adaptable for other countries or purposes. As supplied, if a
postcode page is installed and the contents within the body tags of
"postcode.html" pasted into the page body then a row of buttons will be
presented for each UK post code area. These are horizontal on a wide screen
and vertical on narrow screen. Further guidance appears in the postcode.html
file.
